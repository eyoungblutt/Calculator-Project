<!-- This MVP breaksdown my working process for the calculator project.

The first step is to select a calcualotr online and make sure it covers the project brief. Then I will break the calculator down into a grid format to assist with the layout of the design and HTML.

Create grid layout of calculator - how many columns and rows do I need? Do I do a more responsive grid or do I specify column and row sizes? Should I use a grid or is it better to do flex?

Review the grid sections and assess what are the main elements and how can I break them down in HTML code:
-The top section is a textarea which allows numbers to be displayed - 10 numbers in total. It is a large box - white background, black letters. Find correct font. Not sure if this is a textarea or how the set up here works. Further research to follow.
-The left row has a blue background and darker blue text in different sizes. Create a flex for this and break the text into two portions so you can move them to different places in the flex.
- On the right there is a grey box with three lines down it which is the battery charger. It has shadowing along the top.
- The next left row has four buttons, create a flex to get them in a column one after the other, they will each need to be buttons.
- The center has 12 square buttons, in 3 columns of four.
- The far right column has three buttons and one longer button also in a column.
- The last row has a single long button running through the middle.

With the general elements that I need outlined I will create the html for each div so I have each grid area labeled.

Once the divs for each area are created I will start creating the buttons and the text for each individual div and slot them into the correct areas of the grid.

I will next source the colours from the original image using the eye dropper extension from chrome.

I will implement the display flex and start placing elements roughly where I want them to be, and start styling the buttons.

Throughout I will fine tune the layout/placement of elements and fine tune the code to include necessary mixins and variables.

Insert colour block for battery charger screen.

Research and start experimenting with how we add in the javascript to get the numbers of the calculator to be operational.

Add in input for buttons so that they work and start testing the calculator. -->
